    "# Lab: Oscillations and Introduction to Damping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will study the simple harmonic motion of a mass oscillating on a vertical spring. We will measure the angular frequency of oscillations and compare it to the theoretical prediction, and test how the frequency depends on the amplitude of oscillation. \n",
    "We will also take a first look at the effect of damping on oscillations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Harmonic Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is displaced from equilibrium and experiences a *restoring force*, that results in oscillations known as **simple harmonic motion** (SHM). A classic example of this is the oscillation of a mass on a spring. \n",
    "When the spring is displaced a distance $x$ from equilibrium, the mass $m$ experiences a Hooke's Law force $-kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant. \n",
    "This is a *restoring force* because (a) it is always directed back toward the equilibrium position; and (b) its magnitude increases linearly in proportion to the displacement. \n",
    "The resulting motion of the mass can be described by a sinusoidal function of the time. In the case where the mass begins its motion with at rest (zero initial velocity) at an amplitude $A$ from the equilibrium position, the position at any later time $t$ is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x(t) = A \\cos \\omega t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega$ is the *angular frequency of oscillation*, in units of radians/sec. \n",
    "For motion that does not start specifically at an amplitude \n",
    "(for example, the mass begins at the equilibrium position but is given some non-zero initial velocity),\n",
    "the position function can be described with an additional phase angle $\\phi$ eg $A\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "By considering Newton's Second Law ($F=ma$) applied to the mass $m$ displaced by some distance $x$ from equilibrium, it can be shown that the angular frequency of oscillation depends on the spring constant $k$ and $m$ via:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\omega ^2 = k/m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test this relation in the experiments below, by observing $\\omega$ for different applied masses on an oscillating spring. \n",
    "We will first need to measure the spring constant $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring the Spring Constant k\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the spring constant by hanging different known weights on it, and determining the extension produced. Note that the spring itself may have some mass, but this can be accounted for. \n",
    "Record the height of the spring above the ground using a ruler. Then add additional weights, and each time record the new height (using the same reference point on the spring). Make sure that the spring is not oscillating (yet) so that you can get a consistent height measurement. Translate the measured heights into the extension of the spring. Try to make 4-5 measurements. Then from your data, calculate the spring constant $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Simple Harmonic Motion of an Oscillating Vertical Spring\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the oscillations, we will use a Capstone motion sensor placed on the floor below the spring. Make sure that the spring is properly aligned above the sensor, that it oscillates only vertically, and that there is no side-to-side drift out of range of the sensor. \n",
    "The motion sensor will record the position of the spring as a function of time. \n",
    "The Capstone software can fit this data and determine the angular frequency of oscillations - select the sinusoidal fit function. \n",
    "You should see smooth sine curves showing the oscillations, and the value of the angular frequency $\\omega$ (units of radian/sec) found by the fit. \n",
    "Export the plotted data, including the fit values, as images that you can include in your lab report.\n",
    "(You do not need to export the data points themselves, as you have already got the angular frequency from the Capstone fit, and that is really all you need from the oscillation data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now apply different masses to the spring. Note the total mass, and the measured angular frequency. Using the value you obtained above for $k$, how well does the measured angular frequency agree with the theoretical prediction for a given mass?\n",
    "Do this for 3 different masses. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Test amplitude independence! -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we look again at the theoretical expression for the angular frequency of oscillation, we note that it depends on $k$ and $m$, but does not involve at all the *amplitude* of the motion, $A$. This implies that provided $k$ and $m$ do not change, then oscillations with different amplitude $A$ should still have the same frequency. \n",
    "This may at first seem surprising, because with a larger amplitude, the object has a larger distance to travel in each cycle. \n",
    "But the key is that the Hooke's law force form the spring also increases in magnitude with larger displacements, so these effects cancel each other out.  This amplitude-independence of the oscillation frequency is thus a key prediction of SHM - so let's test it. \n",
    "Keeping the mass the same, try creating oscillations with two different amplitudes. \n",
    "Do your results show a similar value for the oscillation frequency even if the amplitude is significantly different? Print out the plots showing the oscillations and fitted frequency values, to include in your lab report. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Damping\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple harmonic motion occurs when the only force present is the restoring force, such as the Hooke's law force from a stretched spring. \n",
    "An additional velocity-dependent force can cause an effect of *damping* the motion -- the system still oscillates, but the amplitude of oscillation is observed to decay over time. You will learn more about damped oscillations at a later stage in your physics education, but here we will take a quick experimental look at this concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a first study of damping in our setup by increasing the air drag on the oscillating mass.\n",
    "We do this by placing an old CD on top of the mass hanger - this increases the surface area of the system, and now when the mass oscillates, air resistance on the larger surface area introduces a damping force. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capstone software can again be used to fit the oscillating motion in this case. \n",
    "Note that the regular sine function used in the previous measurements probably will not fit well this time.\n",
    "Instead, there is an option to use an alternative *damped sine* function. \n",
    "You should see the effect of damping where the amplitude now decreases over time. \n",
    "What is the time taken for the amplitude to decay to half its original value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look at the angular frequency of the damped oscillations from the fit. If the damping force is relatively small (we call this *under-damping*), the damped oscillations should occur at a frequency that is quite similar to the original undamped frequency. Is that the case for your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we could increase the damping force somewhat, we should see that the amplitude of oscillation would decay even faster. \n",
    "How might you achieve this in a relatively simple way? Test if you can do this, and show this effect of increasing the damping. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assignment for this lab is a short lab report summarising this experiment.\n",
    "Provide a brief introduction to simple harmonic motion for a vertical spring, including the expression for angular frequency that will be tested experimentally.\n",
    "Include your data on the spring constant measurement, and the value you obtained for $k$. \n",
    "For the vertical spring oscillations, discuss how well the measured angular frequency compares to the theoretical prediction, for each mass that you applied. \n",
    "Show the plots from Capstone with the position data versus time and the fitted sine curves, including the $\\omega$ values. \n",
    "Discuss also whether your experiments supported the hypothesis that the oscillation frequency is independent of the initial amplitude of oscillation. \n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to include the studies of damping in your lab report. \n",
