    "# Lab: RC Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **capacitor**  is a device for storing electrical energy/charge. \n",
    "In this lab, we will study the discharging of capacitors with a resistor, and by fitting to the discharge data, determine the time constant for the RC circuit. \n",
    "We will also study combinations of capacitors arranged in series or in parallel, and attempt to verify that the effective capacitances of these systems agrees with the theoretical predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a conductor, electrical current does not flow smoothly through a capacitor, so when a voltage is applied to a capacitor, charges pile up in different regions, creating a charge imbalance. \n",
    "One type of capacitor that is easy to visualise is a parallel-plate capacitor, consisting of two metal plates arranged parallel to each other, but separated so that current cannot flow directly across the gap between plates. In this capacitor, because current cannot flow across the gap, applying a voltage will cause a charge $+q$ to build up on one plate, and $-q$ to build up on the other plate. \n",
    "If the applied voltage is $V$, then the **capacitance** $C$ of a capacitor is defined such that the magnitude of charge $q$ that builds up on one plate is $q=CV$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the total charge is still zero, because the -q and +q regions cancel each other out, since charge is conserved. So we only consider the magnitude of charge on one plate)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discharging a Capacitor\n",
    "\n",
    "When the applied voltage is turned off, we are left with a charge imbalance across the capacitor, and as a result, current starts to flow back in the opposite direction, trying to equalize again and discharge the capacitor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the capacitor is discharging through a resistor $R$. \n",
    "As the capacitor discharges, it generates a time-dependent voltage $V(t)$ based on its capacitance $C$ and the *charge remaining on the plate* at the time $t$, $q(t)$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V(t) = q(t)/C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At time $t$, the current through the resistor $I(t)$ is proportional to the voltage across the resistor at that time $V(t)$, from Ohm's Law: $I(t) = V(t)/R$.\n",
    "And the current itself is simply the rate of change of charge: $I(t) = \\frac{dq}{dt}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can write an equation for the discharge of capacitor $C$ through resistor $R$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dq}{dt} = \\frac{V(t)}{R} = -\\frac{q(t)}{RC}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that we included a minus sign here because the charge is decreasing as the capacitor discharges)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We can integrate this equation to find that the charge remaining on the capacitor at time $t$, $q(t) = q_0 \\exp(-t/RC)$\n",
    "where $q_0$ was the initial charge of the fully-charged capacitor. \n",
    "It's not so easy to measure charge directly, but we can obtain from this an expression for the voltage across the capacitor as a function of time, $V(t)$, and this is something we can measure with a voltmeter. \n",
    "Using $q(t) = C V(t)$, we obtain that the voltage across a capacitor $C$ discharging through a resistor $R$ is given by:\n",
    "$$ V(t) = V_0 \\exp(-t/RC) $$\n",
    "The quantity $RC$ is called the **time constant** of the RC circuit; it measures how quickly the capacitor charges or discharges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capacitors Connected in Parallel in a Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider two capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ connected in parallel, and this capacitor system is then connected in series to a resistor $R$.\n",
    "These two capacitors will behave effectively like a single capacitor $C_p$, but what is the capacitance of $C_p$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the capacitors are in parallel, the same voltage $V$ will get applied to both. But since their capacitances are different, that means the charge built up on each will be different: $q_1 = C_1 V$ and $q_2= C_2 V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the total charge built up on the system will be $q_{tot} = q_1 + q_2$.\n",
    "Therefore the effective capacitance $C_p$ of the system will be related to the total charge $q_{tot}$ and the applied voltage $V$ by: \n",
    "$$q_{tot} = C_p V = q1 + q2 = C_1V + C_2V = (C_1+C_2) V$$\n",
    "From this we can determine that the effective capacitance of capacitors connected in parallel is:\n",
    "$$ C_p = C_1 + C_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capacitors Connected In Series in a Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's consider two capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ connected in series, along with a resistor $R$.\n",
    "The two capacitors will behave effectively like a single capacitor $C_s$, but what is the capacitance of $C_s$?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, there will be a different voltage $V_1$ and $V_2$ across each capacitor, with the total equalling the applied voltage $V = V_1+V_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must consider how the charge builds up on the capacitors, to figure out $V_1$ and $V_2$ separately. \n",
    "First imagine the charge flowing and reaching the *first plate* of the capacitor $C_1$, and then it will stay there, because it cannot flow further. Let's say an amount $q$ builds up on that plate.\n",
    "Then, on the opposite end of the circuit, to conserve charge, an amount $-q$ must build up on the *second plate* of the second capacitor $C_2$.\n",
    " So now we just need to figure out the charge on the second plate of C1 and the first plate of C2.\n",
    " Now, a charge $q$ on the first plate of C1 will repel charge away from it, so the result is that the second plate of C1 will end up with a charge of $-q$. And then to conserve charge, the first plate of C2 (which is connected to the second plate of C1), will end up with a charge $+q$.\n",
    " So there will be a charge $q$ on each capacitor, meaning that they will have a voltage:\n",
    " $V_1 = q/C_1$ and $V_2 = q/C_2$\n",
    " \n",
    " So we can see that the combined set of series capacitors will look like a single capacitor, with charge $q$, applied voltage $V$ and effective capacitance $C_s$ related by:\n",
    " $$ q = C_s V = C_s (V_1 + V_2) = C_s (\\frac{q}{C_1} + \\frac{q}{C_2}) = q C_s(\\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2}) $$\n",
    " Thus we find that:\n",
    " $$ \\frac{1}{C_s} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} $$\n",
    "     \n",
    " \n",

    "### Motivation for Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to test the theoretical capacitor behavior with real capacitors. First we will study the discharge of a single capacitor, and verify that the voltage decays exponentially with time, with a time-constant of $RC$.\n",
    "Then we will combine two capacitors in series/parallel, and verify that the effective capacitance of the system is indeed given by the formulae above relating to the individual capacitances $C_1$ and $C_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Apparatus\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment we will use two capacitors with capacitances $C_1 = 100 \\mu$F and $C_2 = 330 \\mu$F, and a resistor. \n",
    "A power supply will be used to charge the capacitor, and a voltmeter will read the voltage as a function of time. \n",
    "The PASCO 850 Universal Interface equipment will actually be used to provide both these functions. \n",
    "The voltage source should already be configured to provide a square wave, with a peak of 4V, and a frequency of 0.4 Hz (this can be adjusted within the Capstone software if needed).\n",
    "This essentially functions like an on/off switch for the applied voltage, and when 'on' (at the peak of the square wave), it will supply a steady voltage of 4V before it 'turns off'. The frequency setting will allow the capacitor to charge to its maximum before the voltage is turned 'off' again, at which point the capacitor will start to discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reading from the voltmeter as a function of time can be seen from the Capstone software program.\n",
    "This is the data that we will study.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurements to Make\n",
    "\n",
    "First connect the $100\\mu$F capacitor in series with the resistor to the power supply, and make sure the voltmeter is reading the voltage across the capacitor. \n",
    "When you turn on the power supply, the capacitor will cycle through charge/discharge cycles. \n",
    "We will study the discharging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capstone software program should show the voltmeter reading as a function of time. \n",
    "In fact, you should be able to do a large part of the data analysis already within this software. \n",
    "Henry found a nice feature that allows the software to identify the part where the capacitor is discharging and focus on plotting the voltage versus time there. \n",
    "From this plot, you can fit an exponential function $V_0 \\exp(-Bt)$, and Capstone will find the value of $B$ for you. \n",
    "Save the discharge plot as a pdf to include in your lab report, making sure to include the values from the exponential fit. From this you will be able to get the time-constant value $RC$ for this circuit, as we will discuss in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat this study using the other ($330\\mu$F) capacitor, and obtain the exponential fit parameter for this circuit too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now connect the two capacitors in parallel with each other, and then connect this setup in series with the resistor. Ensure that the voltmeter is reading the voltage across both parallel capacitors. From the discharge plot and fit, obtain the exponential fit parameter in this case too.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, try connecting the two capacitors in series with each other and with the resistor. Ensure that the voltmeter is now reading the voltage across *both* capacitors. \n",
    "Studying the discharge will now allow you to determine the effective capacitance of the two capacitors in series. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the measurements, you should have a set of 4 plots, showing the voltage as a function of time for each system as it discharges, and including the results of the best exponential fit $V_0 \\exp(-Bt)$ to this data as determined by the Capstone software. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In each exponential fit to the voltage discharge data, the parameter $B$ in the function $V_0 \\exp(-Bt)$ is related to the **time constant** RC of the circuit by $B = \\frac{1}{RC}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first capacitor, use the known value of its capacitance $C_1$ along with the measured fit parameter $B_1$ to determine a value for the resistance R of the resistor.\n",
    "Repeat this using the information $C_2$ and fit value $B_2$ for the second capacitor. \n",
    "Do you get compatible results for the resistor?\n",
    "What is the percentage difference between the two values obtained for $R$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the cases where the capacitors were connected in series and in parallel. \n",
    "From the measured fit parameters $B_s$ and $B_p$, and the value you just obtained for the resistance $R$ (use the average of the two separate values above), determine the effective capacitances of the two-capacitor system when connected in series ($C_s$) and in parallel ($C_p$). How do your values obtained compare to the expected values using the formulae quoted in the Introduction for series/parallel capacitors?\n",
    "Quantify the difference between the experimental and theoretical values as a fraction of the expected theoretical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you experimentally verified the expected behavior for capacitors connected in series/parallel?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assignment for this Lab is a short report summarizing this experiment. Decribe briefly the physics of capacitors, including the formulas for capacitors connected in series and in parallel. \n",
    "Include a description of the equipment used, and show the voltage plots and fits you obtained. Describe how you extracted from the data values for the effective capacitances of the series/parallel capacitor systems, and discuss how they compare to the theoretical expectations. \n",
